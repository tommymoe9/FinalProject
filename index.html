    <h2> Leading ourselves down the wrong path. </h2>
    <p> The world of crime is a dangerous path for anyone who follows. Since civilization has been made, crime has been inenvitable to all who live in society. Something as simple as theft is estimated to happen every six seconds. Although this and many other stats are scary to the public, illegal actions have taken a background course in everyday life. Citizens should not be scared to be out, but rather informed to stay safe. </p>

    <p>News is a constant source for updates on crime rates throughout the day but for many college students they do not access this due to their focus on schoolwork and social life. There are systematic precautions in place for on-campus danger but this can still leave people vulnerable since they are care free. Students at Syracuse University since May of this year have heard of multiple offenses including an armed robbery and a shooting. Most students are not up to date on these situations and live just a couple blocks away from these altercations.</p>

    <p>College students often, are so caught up in the bubble that is called the time of your life. University means classes, parties, and late-nights but are almost obvious to the reality of crime happening closer than many believe. Neglecting the news or stories is simple, but understand, that is where citizens have run into problems for so long. Crime isn’t something that we should read and forget; it’s issues affecting the community we’re living in. When citizens, especially college students, truly educate themselves is when we can see these crime rates start to decline.</p>

    <h2> What Crime occurs the most in the area? </h2>

    <p class= "caption"> Simple Assault leads in the year of 2021. </p>

    <p> Syracuse, New York is a city that is placed in Up-State New York long away from the worldwide known New York City. Although the attraction levels might not be the highest, the prestigious Syracuse University brings people from across the country to its grounds. This brings both well-minded people and esteemed students. With this, crime still stays afloat in parts of the city.</p>

    <p>Thinking of college students, the most reported acts are usually theft: packages, unlocked vehicles, and burglaries in the east neighborhoods. In specific crimes, simple assaults are the most frequent type of offense with 2,663 occurrences. This crime is one that does not contain certain guidelines to exact cause but can be formed in many ways. Threatening or physical abuse is a primary form of this offense. This crime may not be as serious as others but it still needs to be advised against as you can be charged. </p>

    <p>Criminal mischief is next on this list with 1,787 reported incidents as it portrays harm to all causes on owned property. Although this offense is second on the list for SYR, in 2023 it was the most common crime committed in the United States. There are four degrees of this act but the regular offense is labeled as reckless behavior as the main purpose and is usually defined as "vandalism." The minimum sentence for the lowest degree is at least a year in prison. </p>

    <p> Offenses against family round out the list with 779 cases in 2021. These cases deal with extremely serious issues including assault, sexual abuse, and harassment. Often times these offenses are not reported due to embarrassment or fear. With all these shown, what can the people here in Syracuse do to enhance our well-being and stay safe?</p>

    <h2> How can we improve this for the future? </h2>
    <iframe title="Crime Levels by Month" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-RQhkN" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/RQhkN/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="560" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>
    <p class= "caption"> June and March were the most dangerous in Syracuse. </p>
    <p>Crime rates never take a day off. And especially in Syracuse, it seems to occur more than once. Throughout the 2021 year there were a total of 6,949 crimes; which accounts for over 570 crimes a month. Taking the month with the lowest amount- December - there were over 14 crimes a day. Are there ways to lower these numbers?</p>

    <p>The Department of Public Safety (DPS) is a law enforcement division that's main purpose is to keep college universities safe and carry out policies. Established in Syracuse in 2014, this program has done a great job keeping this campus out of harms way. They have a 24/7 patrol and emergency call center if you cannot reach an officer. </p>

    <p>So how do we improve the rates we see now? DPS and Syracuse's Police Department (SPD) have been working hand-in-hand to eliminate all danger that comes onto campus. While communicating with Ms. Kiana Racha, Internal Communications and Marketing Manager, she mentions how, "we monitor crime trends and identify potential patterns and distribute additional resources to those areas."</p>

    <p>Crime can happen anywhere, even among students which can be more dangerous due to the element of surprise. DPS and SPD have plans set out for this as well. They "run a detail on high traffic nights... members from both departments patrol in the immediate off-campus and fraternity/sorority neighborhoods Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights."</p>

    <p>DPS and SPD have done a great job of protecting this campus from criminal activity for ten years and counting. Illegal activity will always be inevitable but putting trust in those who defend the people and following the rules will lead to a safer future for everyone.
